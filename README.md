## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) often involve mathematical concepts to analyze and optimize algorithms. This repository aims to bridge the gap between DSA and mathematics by providing explanations, examples, and exercises related to basic math concepts commonly used in DSA.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A basic understanding of programming fundamentals.
- Familiarity with at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).

## Math Topics Covered

The repository covers the following basic math problems relevant to DSA:

1. Count digits in a integer.
2. Check a given number is prime or not.
3. Reverse a given number.
4. Print all divisors of a given number.
5. Check a given number is palindrome or not.
6. Check a given number is an armstrong number or not.
7. Greatest common divisor (GCD) of a given two numbers.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
You can then explore the topics by navigating through the folders and reading the documentation.
